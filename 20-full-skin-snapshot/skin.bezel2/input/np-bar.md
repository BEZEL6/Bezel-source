# NP bar / now-playing chrome — np-bar

> **RETIRED 5.33.473.** This layer is frozen at 5.33.267 and may be out of date. The current port blueprint is the behavior file with the same name in [behaviors/](../behaviors/README.md) (Feel contract + Kodi implementation). Kept for history only.


**Object:** `np-bar` · **Layer:** input (actions) · **Last updated:** 2026-11-01 · 5.33.267 · **Status:** current-state, extracted from live XML/Python

## Simple
, **How it works**, **Wiring** (live tree).

**This layer in one line:** what each remote key / touch does on this object, as edges between controls.

## Deep (rebuild detail)
> **Verification (phase 2 hand-check):** auto-extracted rows are kept only where the control id is named in [behavior](../behaviors/np-bar.md); others were stripped as stray. Kept rows are *unverified at runtime* unless a section says hand-verified.
Navigation edges from live controls (Kodi actions → port action names in [keymap-overview](keymap-overview.md)).

| control | Left | Right | Up | Down | Back |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 111 | `` | `` | `171` | `131` | `` |
| 6299 | `60` | `60` | `60` | `60` | `` |

**Semantics from behavior (verbatim lines):**
- the music window is up, or full-screen NP is (`bz_fsnp`);
- | Back in list with NP | Clear `bz_np`, go to 6299 |
